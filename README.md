Source files from various workshops and classes that I've given, on Max and related stuff

## Hybrid Lab
I gave a series of three two-hour talks at the Hybrid Lab at California College for the Arts in San Francisco. These talks focused on using Arduino with Max, for various noisemaking purposes. Week one showed a bunch of examples, along with how to get Max and Arduino talking to each other over Serial. In week two we cobbled together a simple synthesizer that we could play using sensors, and in week three we started some motors turning using controls in Max.
